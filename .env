# Database connection string
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://robert:cookers5@localhost:5432/yarn_inventory

JWT_SECRET=mySecretKeyForJWT

# Port for your backend server
PORT=3001

# API keys for external services
SOME_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
ANOTHER_API_KEY=another_api_key_here
In this example:

DATABASE_URL is the connection string for your PostgreSQL database. Make sure to replace username and password with your actual database username and password, and yarn_inventory with the name of your database.
JWT_SECRET is a secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
PORT is the port where your backend server will run. The value 3001 is just an example; you can change it to your preferred port number.
SOME_API_KEY and ANOTHER_API_KEY are placeholders for API keys to access external services.
You should replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details. Keep in mind that the .env file may contain sensitive information, so be careful not to share it or check it into version control systems like Git.
