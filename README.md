Welcome to the Yarn Inventory and Project Tracking Tool, a comprehensive solution designed for yarn enthusiasts, crocheters, and knitters alike. This project serves as a central hub for managing yarn inventory, tracking project progress, and maintaining a detailed log of various creative endeavors.

The app is hosted at: https://yarnapp-dsx6.onrender.com

1. Key Features:
- Yarn Inventory Management:
- Add, edit, and delete yarn inventory items.
- Include details such as yarn type, brand, color (optional), weight, quantity, lot number (optional), and notes (optional).

2. Project Progress Tracking:
- Utilize timers to monitor progress on ongoing projects.
- Record needle size, eye size (optional), and additional progress notes (optional).

3. Project Logging:
- Log multiple crochet and knitting projects with ease.
- Capture project details, including project name, type, start and end dates, and project notes.

4. Tech Stack:
- Front-end: React for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- Back-end: Node.js to create a robust API for data storage and retrieval.
- Database: Custom API for secure and organized data storage.

5. Project Goals:
Our primary objectives include:
Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience for managing yarn-related information.
Develop a back-end API to handle data storage and retrieval securely.
Enable users to track progress using timers and log detailed information about their creative projects.

6. User Demographics:
This tool caters to a diverse demographic of crafters, from beginners to experienced artisans, who share a common passion for crocheting and knitting. The application is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring accessibility for crafters of all levels.

7. Data Usage and Collection:
Our custom API will store and manage data related to yarn inventory, project progress, and logged projects. Users can input details such as yarn type, completed projects, project progress, needle size, lot number (optional), color (optional), eye size (optional), and notes (optional). The API ensures secure storage and retrieval of this information.

8. Project Approach:
- API Challenges: Addressing data validation challenges and ensuring data integrity, especially handling optional information gracefully.
- Functionality: Offering users the ability to perform CRUD operations, track project progress, and log multiple crochet and knitting projects.
- User Flow: Users can seamlessly navigate the application, add inventory items, track project progress, and log their creative projects using the react-router library.
- Additional Features: Considering stretch goals, we aim to implement features like goal-setting, progress tracking systems, and project deadlines.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
